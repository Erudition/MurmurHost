## Pipecat Migration Constraints
- **Library**: Use `pipecat-ai` with `[google,silero]` extras for Gemini Live integration.
- **Protobuf Conflict**: Due to `pymumble` requiring Protobuf 3.x and Pipecat requiring 4.x/5.x, set `PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python` in the environment.
- **Pymumble Installation**: Install `pymumble` from git (`https://github.com/azlux/pymumble.git`) using `--no-deps` to bypass metadata-level version conflicts.
- **Dependencies**: Manually ensure `opuslib` and `libopus-dev` are installed as they are required by `pymumble` but may be skipped during `--no-deps` install.
- **Service Type**: Use `GeminiLiveLLMService` for native multimodal support.
